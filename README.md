## What tha fork? 

This fork is a legacy version of [Can I take over XYZ?](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz)
This repo will be updated faster and in a clearer manner. 



## What is a subdomain takeover?

> Subdomain takeover vulnerabilities occur when a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) is pointing to a service (e.g. GitHub pages, Heroku, etc.) that has been removed or deleted. This allows an attacker to set up a page on the service that was being used and point their page to that subdomain. 

You can read up more about subdomain takeovers here:

- <https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-ns/>

## Fingerprints and Nuclei templates

The only tool that will be supporting the discovery of takeover is going to be Nuclei (takeover -> template)
